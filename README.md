The Arduino Pro Power Management Library serves as a comprehensive and sophisticated power management toolkit tailored for Arduino Pro boards, encompassing the Portenta H7, Portenta C33, and Nicla Vision. 

This library streamlines the interaction with complex hardware components such as the [PF1550 Power Management Integrated Circuit](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PF1550.pdf) (PMIC) and the [MAX17262 LiPo Fuel Gauge](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX17262.pdf) and presents a user-friendly, functionality-oriented interface.

## ✅ Supported Boards

- Arduino Portenta H7
- Arduino Nicla Vision (Low power features not supported yet)
- Arduino Portenta C33

## Core Components of the Library
The library is organized into three primary parts, each addressing specific aspects of power management:

### 🔋 Battery
Dedicated to battery management, this class enables real-time monitoring of battery usage and health. By keeping track of various battery parameters, users can optimize their applications for better energy efficiency and battery longevity.

### 🔌 Charger
Focused on battery charging dynamics, this class provides a detailed insight into charging parameters. Users can monitor and adjust these parameters, ensuring optimal charging conditions and extending the lifespan of the battery. By default the charger is configured to work with 3.7V batteries which get charged at 4.2V. If you want to use a different type of battery, please take a look at the [API documentation](./docs/api.md).

### ⚙️ Board
This class centralizes control over the power distribution within the board. It allows users to enable or disable specific power rails, catering to the needs of energy-efficient designs. 
In addition to power rail management and battery handling, the library provides power-saving features:

-  **Sleep**
This mode offers a significant reduction in power consumption while maintaining a state of minimal activity. 
It's ideal for applications requiring periodic wake-ups or brief intervals of inactivity. This sleep mode resumes the operation from the last operation.
You can manually enable this sleep mode on the Portenta C33. On the H7 and Nicla Vision however, this is automatically handled by mbed. There is a separate (deep) sleep mode on Portenta H7 and Nicla Vision that can be enabled through their [low power libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_LowPowerPortentaH7).

- **Standby**
For scenarios demanding drastic power conservation, the Standby Mode drastically reduces the board's power usage. It's suitable for long-duration, battery-dependent applications where occasional wake-ups are sufficient. This mode restarts the board on wakeup, effectively running the `setup()` function again. 

#### Low Power Measurements
Here's a table with the current consumption you can expect from each board in Sleep and Standby modes. Clicking on any of the values in the table above will send you to an image of the measurements for that specific scenario.

> [!NOTE]  
> Sleep measurements are not available on the H7 boards because the board goes to sleep automatically when idling.

> [!NOTE]  
> These measurements have been taken using a [Nordic Power Profiler Kit II](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2) through the JST power connector of the Portenta boards,
> the numbers might be higher when powering  through the VIN or 5V pins because it involves more power regulators that are not as efficient as the PF1550's integrated regulators.
